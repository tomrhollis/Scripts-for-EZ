# Scripts-for-EZ
Server side scripts for use on <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock/">Minecraft Bedrock Dedicated Server</a> with <a href="https://github.com/Element-0/ElementZero">ElementZero</a>

These are scripts I use on my personal server, provided as examples or for free use.  Be aware that there is a lot of code that is very specific to my own situation that you will need to adjust. I will be changing the code to be more flexible and less specific when time allows.

Index.js imports a few scripts which can be found at <a href="https://github.com/HongyiMC/EZ-Scripts">HongyiMC's GitHub</a>

Scripts in this repository:

* Index.js: Main server script
* ChatMgr.js: Chat manager script
* Hax.js: Hack retaliation script
* RtpButton.js: Backend code for RTP buttons
* Land.js: Very basic land claim system
